# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition
This Project deals with the process of providing machine the ability to predict the human return digits

1)Hereby I have used the MNIST Database for handwritten digits.Which comprised of nearly 60000 training images and 10000 test data.

2)Used CNN model for training the dataset provided with the Adam optimizer. 

3)To build an interactive window I have created a new file in GUI. In this file, digits can be drawn on canvas, and by clicking a button, you can identify the digit. The Tkinter library is the part of Python standard library. Our predict_digit() method takes the picture as input and then activates the trained model to predict the digit.
